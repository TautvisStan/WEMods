# BookerWinrateTracker
This mod will track your booker mode wrestler wins, draws and losses. Tracks only for people in your fed. Winrates are saved in a Winrates.json file in the config files directory.

You can disable tracking confrontations in the config file.

Advanced winrate display can be enabled in the config file, it will separate the singles, team, and countdown match winrates.

Note: the wrestler winrate will reset if they leave your fed.

# MultiBind

This mod lets players rebind their keyboard controls and share a single keyboard. Thanks to Nifty for an idea.

Controls can be changed in the mod config file. Keybinds that can be changed:
- Movement (arrow keys)
- Attack (A)
- Grapple (S)
- Run (Z)
- Pick up (X)
- Taunt (Space)
- Change focus (Control and Shift)
- Change control (Tab)
- Join the game (NEW) - previously was only available on the controller, now you can join a match in progress (eg. AI only match)

Changing `Esc` and `P` to different buttons is currently not supported.

Pressing `+` on numpad while in the main menu will add a keyboard player, pressing `-` will remove them instead. Supports up to 3 additional players. You can verify it by going into an exhibition mode and clicking on Play.

Controls for each player can be customized in the config file. Additional players can also join the free roam or match in progress by pressing the Join button.

NOTE: Going into controller calibration screen will break added keyboard players. Press Refresh to remove them then add them again in the main menu.

NOTE: This mod may or may not break with an existing controller plugged in.
